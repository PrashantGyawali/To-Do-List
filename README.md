# To-Do-List
My horrible failed attempt at making a simple todo list in vanilla js

Github-pages: https://prashantgyawali.github.io/To-Do-List/

This is the to-do-list thing, I made myself. Didn't watch any follow along tutorials. Has some features like sorting, filtering, searching, editing the to-dos.
Was quite a learning experience.

Though it can still use some improvements, i have decided to move along learning new things rather than perfecting this.
Possible improvements:
-Filtering by Done/Not done
-Better mobile responsiveness(Text may overflow or hide on phones with less width)
-Better Color schemes and dark mode
